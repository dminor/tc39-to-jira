Script to extract data from tc39 dataset for use in jira.

How to use
----------
If run with no argument, the script will fetch the latest
proposals.json from the TC39 dataset repository. For
testing changes to the script, it's possible to pass the
path to a local copy of the proposals.json file.

```
    node main.js [proposals.json]
```
